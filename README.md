# UR5Operation
This github contains all the files to operate the UR5 arm for the purpose of apple picking.

# Motivation
Picking apples is a difficult grasping task that requires specific grasping points and motions to perform well. The best way to pick an apple is to twist it off so
as to not hurt the tree where the apple connects. To pick apples requires a robot that can locate the apple, move a gripper to it, grab the apple firmly without
damaging it and perform this complex action. The code here is designed to move the gripper to the apple and perform the twist.
